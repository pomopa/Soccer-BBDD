## 🧠 Project Description
This project implements a **relational database schema** designed to be scalable, coherent, and capable of meeting a wide range of requirements.  
It populates the database with raw soccer data and performs complex queries to extract meaningful insights.

---

## 📘 Overview of the Schema
The database design consists of **four major sections**, each related to soccer clubs and associated data.  
The implemented relational model can be seen in the image below:
